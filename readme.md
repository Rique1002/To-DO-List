Key Features of a To-Do List App
1. User Interface Elements
Input Field:
Allows users to enter a new task.
Add Task Button:
A button to submit the task entered in the input field.
Task List:
A section (or list) to display currently added tasks.
Delete Button:
Each task should have a delete button to remove it from the list.
Optional Task Completion Indicator:
Optionally, you could use a checkbox or button to mark tasks as completed.
2. Core Functionalities
Add Task:
Users can input a task and click the "Add" button (or press Enter) to add it to the task list.
Display Tasks:
The app displays the list of current tasks in an easy-to-read format.
Delete Task:
Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button associated with each task.
Mark Task as Complete:
Users can indicate that a task is complete, often by checking a checkbox or pressing a “Complete” button. Completed tasks could be visually distinguished (e.g., with a strikethrough).
Clear All Tasks (Optional):
An option to clear all tasks from the list at once.
3. Persistent Storage (Optional)
Local Storage:
The app can save tasks using local storage so they persist even when the page is refreshed. This allows users to close the app and return later, still seeing their tasks.
Cloud Synchronization (Advanced):
For a more advanced app, tasks could be saved to a backend server or cloud storage for synchronization across devices.
4. User Experience Enhancements (Optional)
Edit Task:
Allow users to edit existing tasks after they are added.
Task Due Dates (Advanced):
Users can assign deadlines to tasks and get notifications for due tasks.
Categories/Tags (Advanced):
Organize tasks into categories or add tags for better organization.
Search/Filter Functionality (Advanced):
Enable users to search for tasks or filter them based on criteria such as completed or overdue.

A simple To-Do List app should have an intuitive interface that allows users to easily add, view, and delete tasks. Key functionalities include the ability to add tasks to a list, remove them, and preferably save them persistently. You can further enhance the app with features like editing tasks, marking them as complete, and implementing local storage for a more robust user experience.

This structure will help ensure your To-Do List app is user-friendly and functional, serving as a great practice project for your web development skills.
